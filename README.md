# Example Demo Django Project using HyperComponents

This is a demo Django project that shows how to use HyperComponents

Django: v3.2

## HyperComponents

Basically using `django-components` as the foundation and, then being opinionated in using htmx, hyperscript, and tailwind to achieve UI/UX.

Long-term goal is that HyperComponents be its own standalone Django plugin.

## Theme via Django-Tailwind

In this demo Django project, templates will come from `theme` app.

So we follow the same installation process.

## A Theory of Building Blocks

- Across all developers
- Across some developers
- Across all projects for a single business or developer
- Across a single project
